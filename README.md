This is the first version of the Ontology of Under-represented Writers.

The file underrepresented_countries.owl contains all Countries iso codes, their English labels, urw:HDIIndex, urw:mobilityScore, and urw:mobilityIndex. 

Furthermore, countries are organized by their colonial past (urw:FormerColonyCountry), and their Human Developed Index ranking (urw:veriHighHDI; urw:highHDI; urw:mediumHDI; urw:lowHDI).

The file underrepresented_countries_and_authors.owl contains all authors, their urw:countryOfBirth in ISO format (eg: ITA; USA), their urw:placeOfBirth and urw:birthYear as data properties.
