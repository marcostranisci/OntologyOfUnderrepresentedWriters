Purpose


The purpose of the ontology is to provide a model for the Ontology learning and eliciting of narratives that deals with people or groups of people that are at disadvantage because of their ethnicity.
2
Scope


The ontology scope doesn’t have formal constraints. In fact, narrative can belong to different genres, and media language. Instead, its boundaries are thematic: each story that doesn’t take into account a disadvantaged person for his ethnicity fall outside the ontology purposes.
