<h2>The Under-represented Writers project</h2>
<p>The Under-represented Writer project is a research aimed at exploring the under-representation of non-Western writers in the digital landscape, and more specifically on Wikidata and Wikipedia. The projectis is composed of three part:</p>

1. [A Semantic Model](https://github.com/marcostranisci/UnderRepresentedWritersProject/tree/main/Ontologies) for the encoding of writers and their works. The folder contains the Under-Represented Writers Ontology (urw), and the Under-Represented Books Ontology (urb). In addition, a semantic mapping between urw and the dolce ontology is provided.
2. [A Knowledge Graph](https://github.com/marcostranisci/UnderRepresentedWritersProject/tree/main/KnowledgeGraph) of authors and works gathered from Wikidata, Wikipedia, OpenLibrary, Goodreads, and Google Books. Within the folder you can find all the r2rml mapping files for populating the semantic models and links for downloading the SQL database used for the mapping, and the materialized triples in .ttl format.
3. A set of NLP experiments for [biographical events extraction](https://github.com/marcostranisci/UnderRepresentedWritersProject/tree/main/BiographicalEventsExtraction). In this folder you can find a Lexico-Semantic Pattern approach for extracting migration events from Wikipedia biographies, and a corpus of sentences annotated with semantic roles.  

<p> The project is curated by a team from the University of Turin, Department of Computer Science, and is hosted at https://underrepresented.di.unito.it.   </p>
