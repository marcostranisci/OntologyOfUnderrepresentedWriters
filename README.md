This is the first version of the Ontology of Under-represented Writers.

The file underrepresented_countries.owl contains all Countries iso codes, their English labels, urw:HDIIndex, urw:mobilityScore, and urw:mobilityIndex. 

Furthermore, countries are organized by their colonial past (urw:FormerColonyCountry), and their Human Developed Index ranking (urw:veriHighHDI; urw:highHDI; urw:mediumHDI; urw:lowHDI).

If you want the KG with all authors, download the <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1WRMrYVF7YT6OPR_bcQ00Av6Q4OZknSqV/view?usp=sharing"> underrepresented.owl file</a> that contains their urw:countryOfBirth in ISO format (eg: ITA; USA), their urw:placeOfBirth and urw:birthYear, and urw:wikipediaText as data properties.
